    <h1>Adaptive Nerf Targeting System</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Our project is an adaptive targeting system that uses pressure sensor
        feedback to automatically realign a motor-controlled platform that holds
        a Nerf gun toward the center of a target. It consists of two
        communicating pieces: a Nerf gun stand that moves up, down, left, and
        right, and a pressure-sensor-covered target that sends feedback for
        alignment corrections.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2>2. Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        The problem we are solving is the aiming of a projectile. Our project
        controls a Nerf gun with a 2-axis motor system informed by feedback from
        a peripheral target device, aiming for more accurate firing.

      <h3>3. Results</h3>

      <h4>3.1 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Results</h4>
      <p>
        We met all our expectations. Some requirements changed — LCD screen use
        was dropped, RF receive interrupts were added, and requirement precision
        improved. See below for validations:

      <h4>3.2 Hardware Requirements Specification (HRS) Results</h4>
      <p>
        All hardware requirements were met. Some requirements evolved to improve
        reliability, including de-noising RF circuits and specifying target
        launch distances.

      <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>What we learned:</strong> We gained hands-on embedded systems
        experience, especially with RF modules, motor control, and precision
        mechanisms. We also learned the value of careful planning before
        construction.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What went well:</strong> The full system loop — fire, hit,
        adjust, fire again — worked reliably. We achieved fast RF communication,
        effective up/down movement, and a consistent trigger mechanism.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What we're proud of:</strong> Integrating independent modules
        into a functioning autonomous system that consistently realigned itself
        toward the target.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Changes we made:</strong> We redesigned the motor stand to
        separate vertical and horizontal movement for stability and precision.
        We replaced earlier design ideas with more effective nut-and-bolt linear
        motion.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Unexpected challenges:</strong> Inconsistent Nerf bullet
        trajectories added randomness that was difficult to fully compensate for
        despite precise motor adjustments.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Next steps:</strong> Future improvements could include building
        a more accurate firing mechanism and adding a vision-based aiming system
        using cameras and computer vision.
