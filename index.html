      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Our project is an adaptive targeting system that uses pressure sensor
        feedback to automatically realign a motor-controlled platform that holds
        a Nerf gun toward the center of a target. It consists of two
        communicating pieces: a Nerf gun stand that moves up, down, left, and
        right, and a pressure-sensor-covered target that sends feedback for
        alignment corrections.

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        The problem we are solving is the aiming of a projectile. Our project
        controls a Nerf gun with a 2-axis motor system informed by feedback from
        a peripheral target device, aiming for more accurate firing.

      <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>What we learned:</strong> - This project helped us learn about
        numerous embedded software systems. Before this, we had never worked
        with RF modules, nor very much with motors. Some of the previous lab
        components had some basic motor coding, but this project really got down
        to the precise movement of the stepper motors we used, which allowed for
        extreme precision. We also learned about how important ideating is
        before building. There were multiple times where we implemented ideas
        and made them partially permanent (such as using super glue) before
        properly testing them. For example, the first four buttons we put in the
        target were too low down from the springs, so it made it really
        difficult for the bullet force to press them in, but they were all
        superglued in, so we had to break them out using heat and chip off parts
        of our backing board. If we had used a less permanent seal and then
        tested, it would have been a lot easier to fix.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What went well:</strong> The project overall went very well!
        While there were some longer nights, we got all of our requirements
        working, and the full loop of the system (as in, fire, hit, move,
        adjust, repeat) worked really well. While the gun being inaccurate was
        our main bottleneck, that was out of our control, and all of the items
        we implemented were quite effective. The RF modules worked really well
        together and sent and received signals very quickly to ensure the
        movement wasn't delayed for a long time. Another part of the project
        that went well was the Up/Down motor system as well as the trigger
        mechanism. While these both took some ideating, we ultimately had
        systems that had precise (86 nm) movement, and a trigger mechanism that
        successfully pushed the bullet into the chamber so it could be fired
        multiple times in a row without us having to interact with the system at
        all.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What we're proud of:</strong> We are most proud of all of our
        components working together after working separately. We had a good
        motor stand, a working target module, and RF working, and then when we
        were able to write code that seamlessly integrated all of them to work
        in the looping system, it was extremely satisfying. Seeing the bullet
        hit the top middle target module and move down right to the middle and
        hit the middle without us interacting with the system at all was very
        exciting!
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Changes we made:</strong> We had to significantly change our
        approach from the original motor stand idea. Originally, the design was
        very unbalanced, with one motor sitting on top of the other, which
        prevented precise control and caused torque issues. We then decided to
        split the motors into two separate modules that sat on the tabletop.
        Next, we needed to address the challenge of converting rotational motion
        into up-and-down movement. We decided to use a nut and bolt mechanism,
        where the bolt was attached to the motor and moved up and down along a
        stand that the top of the motor sat on. This allowed us to achieve
        extremely precise vertical movement. Finally, we placed the nose of the
        gun on a smooth acrylic flat top, allowing it to move left and right
        easily. We considered adding a wheel to further reduce friction, but the
        acrylic surface was already sufficiently smooth.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Could Have Been Done Differently:</strong> Two things that could
        have been done differently are using pressure sensors instead of buttons
        for the target, and using a nut and bolt setup for the left and right
        motor as well, so we could have had the same level of precision for both
        axes. Pressure sensors would have eliminated some of the issues we had
        where the bullets did not apply enough force for the buttons to fully
        press down, or did not register because they pressed down too quickly.
        If we had used pressure sensors, it would have always registered, and we
        would have had more control over where on the sensor it was hit. In
        terms of the left-right movement, using a nut and bolt setup would have
        given us much more control, as the left-right movement we ended up with
        was somewhat volatile and inconsistent.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Unexpected challenges:</strong> One of the main obstacles was
        the Nerf gun bullets being inconsistent. With a project that relies on
        precision, we would have wanted to create a system that didn't rely on
        the bullets firing in random directions. Unfortunately, because the
        firing direction varied slightly from shot to shot, it made it harder to
        consistently hit the target, adjust for it, and have it hit exactly
        where we adjusted it to. While we were able to design the motors and
        movement system to adjust and compensate as much as possible, the
        randomness of the bullet paths was something that we couldn't fully
        control.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Next steps:</strong> In order to remove more of the randomness,
        we would have wanted a more accurate firing tool. Perhaps we could
        create our own firing tunnel with servos inside it, making it both more
        powerful and more accurate. This would help ensure the bullet can push
        the buttons properly and be more reliable overall. Another possible next
        step could be adding a vision system, such as a simple camera to detect
        the exact location of the target and adjust the aim dynamically before
        firing.
