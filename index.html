      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        AutoAlign is an adaptive targeting system that uses pressure sensor
        feedback to automatically realign a motor-controlled platform that holds
        a Nerf blaster toward the center of a target. It consists of two
        communicating pieces: a Nerf blaster stand that moves up, down, left,
        and right, and a pressure-sensor-covered target that sends feedback for
        alignment corrections.

        We met all our expectations. Some requirements changed â€” LCD screen use
        was dropped, RF receive interrupts were added, and requirement precision
        improved. See below for validations:

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <h3>What we learned:</h3>
  <p>
    This project helped us learn about numerous embedded software systems.
    Before this, we had never worked with RF modules, nor very much with
    motors. Some of the previous lab components had some basic motor coding,
    but this project really got down to the precise movement of the stepper
    motors we used, which allowed for extreme precision. We also learned
    about how important ideating is before building. There were multiple
    times where we implemented ideas and made them partially permanent (such
    as using super glue) before properly testing them. For example, the
    first four buttons we put in the target were too low down from the
    springs, so it made it really difficult for the bullet force to press
    them in, but they were all superglued in, so we had to break them out
    using heat and chip off parts of our backing board. If we had used a
    less permanent seal and then tested, it would have been a lot easier to
    fix.
  </p>

  <h3>What went well:</h3>
  <p>
    The project overall went very well! While there were some longer nights,
    we got all of our requirements working, and the full loop of the system
    (as in, fire, hit, move, adjust, repeat) worked really well. While the
    gun being inaccurate was our main bottleneck, that was out of our
    control, all of the items we implemented were quite effective. The
    RF modules worked really well together and sent and received signals
    very quickly to ensure the movement wasn't delayed for a long time.
    Another part of the project that went well was the up/down motor system
    as well as the trigger mechanism. While these both took some ideating,
    we ultimately had systems that had precise (86 nm) movement, and a
    trigger mechanism that successfully pushed the bullet into the chamber
    so it could be fired multiple times in a row without us having to
    interact with the system at all.
  </p>

  <h3>What we're proud of:</h3>
  <p>
    We are most proud of all of our components working together after
    working separately. We had a good motor stand, a working target module,
    and RF working, and then when we were able to write code that seamlessly
    integrated all of them to work in the looping system, it was extremely
    satisfying. Seeing the bullet hit the top middle target module and move
    down right to the middle and hit the middle without us interacting with
    the system at all was very exciting!
  </p>

  <h3>Changes we made:</h3>
  <p>
    We had to significantly change our approach from the original motor
    stand idea. Originally, the design was very unbalanced, with one motor
    sitting on top of the other, which prevented precise control and caused
    torque issues. We then decided to split the motors into two separate
    modules that sat on the tabletop. Next, we needed to address the
    challenge of converting rotational motion into up-and-down movement. We
    decided to use a nut and bolt mechanism, where the bolt was attached to
    the motor and moved up and down along a stand that the top of the motor
    sat on. This allowed us to achieve extremely precise vertical movement.
    Finally, we placed the nose of the gun on a smooth acrylic flat top,
    allowing it to move left and right easily. We considered adding a wheel
    to further reduce friction, but the acrylic surface was already
    sufficiently smooth.
  </p>

  <h3>What could have been done differently:</h3>
  <p>
    Two things that could have been done differently are using pressure
    sensors instead of buttons for the target and using a nut and bolt
    setup for the left and right motor as well, so we could have had the
    same level of precision for both axes. Pressure sensors would have
    eliminated some of the issues we had where the bullets did not apply
    enough force for the buttons to fully press down or did not register
    because they pressed down too quickly. If we had used pressure sensors,
    it would have always registered, and we would have had more control over
    where on the sensor it was hit. In terms of the left-right movement,
    using a nut and bolt setup would have given us much more control, as the
    left-right movement we ended up with was somewhat volatile and
    inconsistent.
  </p>

  <h3>Unexpected challenges:</h3>
  <p>
    One of the main obstacles was the Nerf gun bullets being inconsistent.
    With a project that relies on precision, we would have wanted to create
    a system that didn't rely on the bullets firing in random directions.
    Unfortunately, because the firing direction varied slightly from shot to
    shot, it made it harder to consistently hit the target, adjust for it,
    and have it hit exactly where we adjusted it to. While we were able to
    design the motors and movement system to adjust and compensate as much
    as possible, the randomness of the bullet paths was something that we
    couldn't fully control.
  </p>

  <h3>Next steps:</h3>
  <p>
    In order to remove more of the randomness, we would have wanted a more
    accurate firing tool. Perhaps we could create our own firing tunnel with
    servos inside it, making it both more powerful and more accurate. This
    would help ensure the bullet can push the buttons properly and be more
    reliable overall. Another possible next step could be adding a vision
    system, such as a simple camera to detect the exact location of the
    target and adjust the aim dynamically before firing.
